Design Requirements:

**Core Style: Minimalist High-End, Magazine Style, "Apple" Aesthetic.**

1.  **Background & Atmosphere**:
    *   **Extremely Clean**: Use solid colors (off-white, light gray, soft beige) or very subtle gradients.
    *   **Abstract**: Use abstract geometric shapes (soft blobs, lines, circles) as background decoration.
    *   **NO Realistic Photos**: Do NOT generate specific scenes (like a room, a desk, a person). Keep it abstract and conceptual.
    *   **White Space**: Leave plenty of breathing room (negative space). Do not fill every corner.

2.  **Typography & Layout**:
    *   **Clean & Modern**: Use modern sans-serif fonts.
    *   **Hierarchy**: Title should be large and bold. Body text should be smaller and clearly aligned.
    *   **Structured**: Use simple cards, lines, or bullet points to organize text.
    *   **High Contrast**: Ensure text is perfectly readable against the background (e.g., dark text on light background).

3.  **Color Palette**:
    *   **Restrained**: Use a limited color palette (max 2-3 main colors).
    *   **Sophisticated**: Use low-saturation, high-value colors (e.g., Morandi colors, premium gray, classic black & white with an accent color).
    *   **Avoid**: Neon colors, clashing colors, rainbow gradients.

4.  **Specific Page Guidelines**:
    *   **[Cover]**: Large, bold title in the center or top-left. Minimalist graphic focus. High impact but clean.
    *   **[Content]**: Clear information hierarchy. Use ample line spacing. Just text and simple layout structure.
    *   **[Summary]**: Simple closing statement in the center.

**NEGATIVE PROMPT (What to AVOID):**
*   **NO** Blur, bokeh, depth of field, tilt-shift, fuzziness.
*   **NO** Low resolution, jpeg artifacts, compression artifacts, pixelated.
*   **NO** Cluttered background, messy details, random objects.
*   **NO** Realistic photography, photorealistic scenes, people, faces, hands.
*   **NO** Cartoonish, cute, childish styles, excessive emojis.
*   **NO** Phone bezels, mockups, frames, white borders.

**Input Content to Render:**
{page_content}

**Page Type**: {page_type}
*(If not Cover, maintain consistency with the Cover style)*

**Original Topic**: {user_topic}

Generate a **vertical (3:4)** image that looks like a **High-Resolution, Vector-Style, 8K Ultra-HD** premium designed poster. Focus on *Typographic Design* and *Layout*.Ensure **text is vector-sharp** and background is clean.
