Design Requirements:

**Core Style: Hand-Drawn Sketchnote / Doodle Infographic**

This style looks like it was drawn by hand with marker pens on a whiteboard or textured paper. Lines are imperfect and wobbly, colors are pastel highlighters, and the overall feel is informal, friendly, and educational.

## 1. Visual Style Elements

### Linework:
- **Black ink outlines**: Slightly wobbly and imperfect, like marker pen sketches
- **Hand-drawn feel**: Lines should NOT be perfectly straight or smooth
- **Casual strokes**: Similar to what you'd draw on a whiteboard

### Color Palette (Pastel Markers):
- **Primary**: Highlighter yellow (淡黄色, pastel yellow)
- **Secondary**: Light cyan/blue (淡青蓝色), soft pink (柔粉色)
- **Background**: Off-white, textured paper feel (米白色纸张)
- **Ink**: Black for all outlines
- **Style**: Colors should look like marker highlighter strokes, often loosely applied over the lines (not perfectly within boundaries)

### Background:
- Textured off-white or cream-colored paper (NOT pure white)
- Subtle paper grain texture
- Light, subtle decorative blobs in pastel colors

---

## 2. Icons & Illustrations

Use simple, cute, hand-drawn style icons:
- Stick figures (火柴人)
- Simple line-art robots (简笔画机器人)
- Basic shapes: circles, arrows (手绘箭头 →), checkmarks ✓, X marks ✗
- Educational icons: gears, checklists, question marks, lightbulbs
- Numbered circles: ①②③ or 1, 2, 3 in circles

---

## 3. Typography

- **Titles**: Bold, blocky hand-lettered style (粗壮的手写体)
- **Body text**: Casual handwritten script
- **Emphasis**: Key words highlighted with pastel color blocks behind them
- All text should look hand-written, NOT computer fonts

---

## 4. Layout Structure

- Step-by-step flowcharts with hand-drawn arrows connecting elements
- Numbered sections with circles
- Information organized in a clear but casual manner
- Ample white space between sections

Generate a **vertical (3:4)** infographic illustration in a hand-drawn sketchnote and doodle style on textured off-white paper. The linework should be black ink, slightly wobbly and imperfect like marker pen sketches. Use pastel marker colors: highlighter yellow, light cyan blue, and soft pink as accents. Include simple cute icons like stick figures and line-art elements. All text should appear hand-lettered. The overall feel should be informal, educational, friendly, and playful - like visual notes drawn on a whiteboard.
